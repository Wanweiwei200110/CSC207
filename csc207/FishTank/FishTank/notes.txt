#########
# Step 1
Code affected: none
Created this file.
#########
# Step 2
Code affected: all .java files
Reformatted using the Google Java style formatter.
#########
# Step 3
Code affected: Fish.turnAround
Flaw: unnecessary if, leading to duplicate code.
Fix: replaced if statement with a single assignment statement.
#########
# Step 4
Code affected: Bubble, Seaweed, FishTankManager, Fish, HungryFish
Flaw: some badly named instances, bad position of declaring instances.
Fix: name changed: d -> decision, l -> length, myLittleFishes -> FishTankItems(changed again later, f should not be capitalized)
Moved declaration of my_curr_row, my_curr_col to the front.
# Step 5
Code affected: HungryFish, FishTankManager, Bubble
Flaw: duplicate code in HungryFish, random variable decision in Bubble. Public instance variables.
Fix: added inheritance relationship between Fish and HungryFish.
Wrote a method creating random double in Bubble class.
Fixed typos.
Changed all public instance variables into private, wrote getter and setter for private instance variables.
# Step 6
Code affected: Bubble, Seaweed, FishTankManager, Fish, HungryFish
Flaw: duplicate code and structure.
Fix: added a new abstract class FishTankItem that is the parent of Bubble, Fish and Seaweed.
# Step 7
Code affected: Bubble, Seaweed, FishTankManager, Fish, HungryFish, FishTankItem
Flaw: nested if statements and many castings when calling move() method. Badly named instance variable.
Methods have public access modifier. Inefficient 2D array.
Fix: added abstract method move() to FishTankItem to use polymorphism.
Name changed: FishTankItems -> fishTankItems
Changed methods modifiers into default(package private).
Changed array fishTankItems into ArrayList.
# Step 8
Code affected: Bubble, Seaweed, FishTankManager, Fish, HungryFish
Flaw: static fishTankItems.
Fix: make fishTankItems not static, changed subclasses' constructor, let them store a manager instance.
Changed Fish.blowBubble() to that all items in the same tank share the same manager.
# Step 9
Code affected: Bubble, FishTankManager
Flaw: complicated move() for bubbles.
Fix: deleted instance variable decision, made it local for move() function.
Deleted floatStraightUp(), floatRightUp(), floatLeftUp(), move the functionality into move() method and simplified.
# Step 10
Code affected: Fish, HungryFish
Flaw: bug created by myself: problem displaying hungry fish due to undefined paintText color.
Fix: optimized constructor in both classes.
# Step 11
Code affected: Fish
Flaw: use "+=" for String concatenation takes extra memory space in reverseAppearance().
Fix: used mutable StringBuilder instead.
# Step 12
Code affected: Seaweed
Flaw: missing seaweed segment and wired if conditions in draw().
Fix: simplified the condition and added the missing segment.
# Step 13
Code affected: Bubble, Seaweed, FishTankManager, Fish, HungryFish
Flaw: unclear comments.
Fix: gave more clear and concise comments.
Add @Override before methods that overrides the parent functions.
#########
# Step 14 (N-1)
Code affected: Fish, HungryFish
Flaw: fish don't turn around when hit the wall.
Fix: changed the logic in move() in Fish and HungryFish let the fish turn around when they hit the wall.
Tested some number to adjust the conditions that trigger the turnAround() method.
Fish and HungryFish have different numbers to adjust the condition so the move() method is implemented in both classes.
# Step 15
Code affected: Fish, HungryFish
Flaw: duplicate code in both classes. Number for adjustment is a bit off.
Fix: created helper moveControl() in Fish so that HungryFish can inherit the duplicate part. Updated the number for better display effect.
# Step 16
Code affected: Bubble
Flaw: bubbles flow out of bounds still exist in memory.
Fix: updated Bubble.move(), delete the bubble that is out of bound.
# Step 17
Code affected: Bubble, FishTankItem, Fish, HungryFish, Seaweed
Flaw: out of bounds bubbles are deleted form FishTankManager but still have the manager as their instance variables.
Fix: updated Bubble.move(), set the manager to null.
method name changed: assignManager -> setManager
#########
# Step 18 (N)
Code affected: Fish, Bubble, HungryFish, Seaweed
Change: added moveHorizontally() and moveVertically() to make easier move() method.
New classes added: TimidTadpole and SingingSquid.
Tadpoles are very timid that die when the squid nearby is singing.
When they die, they move downwards until they touch the floor, then they are deleted from the manager to save memory.
Squids like to sing when tadpoles are nearby.
When they sing, they go up until reach the surface of water, then they stop singing and quickly goes down a bit.
# Step 19
Code affected: TimidTadpole, SingingSquid, Fish, HungryFish
Change: added method regularMove() that stores the common movements shared by all fish to reduce duplicate code.
# Step 20
Code affected: TimidTadpole, SingingSquid, Fish, Bubble
Change: updated logic controlling when tadpoles die and when squids sing.
Changed color of tadpoles and squids.
Fixed some typos and unclear parts in notes.
Changed type declaration of fishTankItems form Arraylist to List.
# Step 21 (N+1)
Code affected: TimidTadpole, SingingSquid, Fish, Bubble, HungryFish, Seaweed
Change: numbered steps in notes to increase readability.
changed x, y coordinate in drawString() in Fish
Code smells fixed in previous steps(see details from steps above):
    step4: bad position of instance variable declaration, bad name
    step5: public instance variables
    step7: public methods, many castings
    step11: "+=" for String concatenation
    step12: wired if condition in Seaweed.draw()
added comments and javadoc to every instance variable and method.
# Step 22
Code affected: TimidTadpole, SingingSquid, Fish, Bubble, HungryFish, Seaweed
Change: changed coordinate order in drawString() in Bubble and Seaweed.
added javadoc for methods.
Fixed code smell: unused color instance in Seaweed removed, unused import removed
# Step 23
Code affected: Seaweed
Fixed code smell: removed unnecessary manager instance variable since it can set manager to the super class level.
changed access modifier of instance variables to private.
changed access modifier of instance variables to private.
#Step 24
Code affected: TimidTadpole, SingingSquid, Fish
Change: added comments to javadoc that was missed before.
Added @Override before the methods that override parent method.
# Step 25
Code affected: TimidTadpole, SingingSquid, Fish, Bubble, HungryFish, Seaweed
Fixed code smell: some lines are too long, made them short by let them continue on the next line.
# Step 26
Code affected: Fish, FishTankItem
Change: added comments to javadoc that was missed before.
# Step 27
Code affected: FishTankManager, SingingSquid
Change: found some errors of comments in javadoc, now fixed.
